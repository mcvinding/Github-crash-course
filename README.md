# Using Git/GitHub in Scientific Collaborations

This is the GitHub repository with material for the Git/GitHub crash course **Using Git/GitHub in Scientific Collaborations** at NatMEG, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden. Here you will find the handouts from the lecture and the tutorial material for the exercise. The goal is to get you started using Git and GitHub for managing and sharing analysis scripts and experiments in scientific collaboration.

We will start from the absolute beginning, assuming no prior experience with Git and (hopefully) reach a point where you can use it well enough for managing scientific projects on GitHub.

## Overview
This crash course is a short lecture that introduce the basics of Git and GitHub and an online tutorial that covers the basics for using Git/GitHub. The handout slides from the lecture is in the folder `lecture_handouts`. 

See the document `Setup_guide.md` how to get started with GitHub if this is the first time you are using GitHub. Please make sure that you have gone though this setup guide before the workshop.

The tutorial is in the file `Tutorial.md`. Click on the file above to get started.

The folder `friday_toolbox` contains the code you will be working on during the tutorial exercise.

## Getting started

For the tutorial, you need:
1. A GitHub account. If you do not already have one, you can create one for free on https://github.com/
2. Git installed on your local computer. See here how to install: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git. (*If you are working on the NatMEG server Compute, you already have Git installed*)

**Important:**
If you have not used Git before (on your local computer or NatMEG's server) you need to check the configuration before you can use Git and run the tutorials. You will find a guide how to do the configuration [here](./tutorial/Setup_guide.md ), before you proceed to the tutorials.
