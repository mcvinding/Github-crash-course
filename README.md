# Using Git/GitHub in Scientific Collaborations

This is the GitHub repository with material for the Git/GitHub crash course **Using Git/GitHub in Scientific Collaborations** at NatMEG, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden. Here you will find the handouts from the lecture and the tutorial material for the exercise. The goal is to get you started using Git and GitHub for managing and sharing analysis scripts and experiments in scientific collaboration.

We will start from the absolute beginning, assuming no prior experience with Git and (hopefully) reach a point where you can use it well enough for managing scientific projects on GitHub.

## Overview
This crash course consists of a short lecture that introduces the basics of Git and GitHub and an online tutorial that covers the basics of using Git/GitHub. The handout slides from the lecture are in the folder `lecture_handouts`. 

The tutorial with the exercises you have to do during the course is in the file `Tutorial.md`. Click on the file above to get started.

The folder `friday_toolbox` contains the code you will be working on during the tutorial exercise.

## Getting started

For the tutorial, you need the following:
1. A GitHub account (if you do not already have one).
2. Git installed on your local computer.
3. Link your GitHub account to your local Git.

If this is your first time using GitHub, see the document `Setup_guide.md` for instructions on how to get started. Please make sure that you have gone through this setup guide before the workshop.

**Important:**
If you have not used Git before (on your local computer or NatMEG's server), you need to check the configuration before you can use Git and run the tutorials. You will find a guide on how to do the configuration in the setup guide ([here](./Setup_guide.md )).
